# Python Weather API

Developed a Python script to visualize the weather of cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. This project randomly selects 500 cities based on latitude and longitude and performs a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.

Scatter plots were then built to showcase the following relationships:
* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
